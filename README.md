# COVID-19 Unemployment Analysis in India

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing unemployment patterns in India before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this project is to identify trends, patterns, and underlying factors contributing to changes in unemployment rates over time.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [CIME](insert link to CIME website or dataset). It includes [describe the key attributes and structure of the dataset, such as columns, data types, and time frame covered]. Additionally, any supplementary datasets or external sources utilized for contextual analysis are listed here.

## Project Structure

- `Datasets/`: Contains raw datasets used in the analysis.
- `UnempEDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data extraction, wrangling, and exploratory data analysis.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License file.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing necessary dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asvcodes/Covid19-Unemp-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Covid19-Unemp-Analysis
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Extraction

The data extraction process involves collecting relevant datasets related to unemployment in India. Detailed documentation and scripts for retrieving data from various sources are provided in the `data_extraction/` directory.

## Data Wrangling

In the data wrangling phase, the raw data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis. The `data_wrangling/` directory contains scripts and notebooks demonstrating these data preparation steps.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis involves visually exploring the dataset, identifying patterns, correlations, and trends. Jupyter notebooks and visualizations showcasing the EDA process are available in the `exploratory_data_analysis/` directory.

## Results and Insights

The analysis results, insights, and key findings are summarized in the project documentation and Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, visualizations and statistical analysis outputs provide a comprehensive understanding of unemployment trends in India before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
